# Docs-Diversity-Inclusion-Badging

This is the repository that houses all documentation related to the Diversity & Inclusion Badging Project

## Goal

The goal of the Diversity & Inclusion Badging Program is to encourage projects and events to obtain D&I badges for reasons of pride, leadership, self-reflection, and self-improvement on issues critical to building the Internet as a social good.

Here are the primary deliverables of the Diversity & Inclusion Badging Program:

  * Establish an environment where projects and events can engage in the badging program
  * Aligning the badging program with best practices, guidelines and recommendations from Diversity & Inclusion efforts on the CHAOSS project
  * Connecting with existing badging standards of IMS Global including
  * Building an open, peer-review system for the D&I Badging Program

### Problem Statement

Diversity in open source is opaque to participants, newcomers, and stakeholders because contributors are distributed, and in many cases are an agglomeration of individuals in different locations. Inclusivity for open source projects is impeded by long standing practices that have side effects that act to reproduce the current state of limited diversity.

### Opportunity

The project aims to increase understanding of the open source project and event practices that encourage greater diversity and wider inclusion of people from different backgrounds.

## Work to Date

The project is in its beginning stages. See the issue templates for the most up-to-date work.
